**ABSTRACT :**
Breast cancer is the leading factor causing cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and lower fatality rates. Recent advances in machine learning have shown promising results in predicting breast cancer. This study uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset for training and
the Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital dataset for testing to compare the performance of three well-known classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). The data is preprocessed by scaling and partitioning. The evaluation of each algorithm's performance on the testing dataset
involves measuring its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics followed by
training on the training dataset. The results reveal that SVM and Random Forest perform
better than Logistic Regression in terms of accuracy and F1-score. The study
demonstrates that machine learning algorithms, especially SVM and Random Forest, can
accurately predict breast cancer, which can aid in early detection and improve patient
outcomes. These models can assist doctors in identifying breast cancer more precisely,
leading to fewer unnecessary biopsies and better patient outcomes. The findings of this
research can be applied in clinical settings for early detection and treatment of breast
cancer, with significant implications for improving breast cancer diagnosis and patient
outcomes.
